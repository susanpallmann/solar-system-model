# Solar System Model
Just for fun: creating a model of the solar system that semi-accurately represents relative speeds, orbits, rotations, etc.

Also on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/susanpallmann/pen/eYZLBeN)

## Notes
### Relative Accuracy
Although the original goal was to have all attributes (size, speed, distance from sun) be to scale, it became evident very quickly that this would not be practical on a website. The sun, when to scale with the other planets, took up nearly the entire page. If I made the overall scale smaller to compensate, then planets like Mercury were barely visible. Having orbital distance from the Sun relative to scale of planets made the page so long it was difficult to *find* a planet. 

So, in the interest of making something that still looks reasonable, accuracy is only within certain guides.

* Planetary distances from the sun are proportional to each other.
* Planetary sizes are proportional to each other.
* Planetary orbital speeds are proportional to each other.
* Planetary sizes and distances from the sun are not proportional to each other.
* Orbit speed is not proportional to distances or sizes.
* The sun's size is not proportional to anything. It's too ridiculously big. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Scaling
As mentioned, many variables of this model are not to scale with each other.

##### Planet Size
```javascript
const size = obj.diameter * 0.001;
$('#' + planet).css({
	'height' : size + 'px',
	'width' : size + 'px',
});
```
To set the size, the diameter stored (in km), is reduced to one thousandth, and then set to pixels.

##### Distance from Sun
```javascript
const distance = obj.sunDistance * 0.3 + 50;
const sunOffset = storeSunOffset();
$('#' + planet).css({
	'top' : distance + sunOffset + 'px',
});
```
The distance from the sun is first offset by a sunOffset amount (120px in this case). This is because the sun in my model is 40px in diameter, and is placed 100px from the top of the page. In order to have the planets orbit around the center of the sun, this distance has to be accounted for in the planet's "top" style. From there, distance is reduced to 30% (keeping in mind that this is 30% of 10^6 km). An extra 50px is added just to allow stylistic distance from the Sun. This particular number is arbitrary and not accurate to the model.
