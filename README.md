# Solar System Model
Just for fun: creating a model of the solar system that semi-accurately represents relative speeds, orbits, rotations, etc.

Also on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/susanpallmann/pen/eYZLBeN)

## Notes
### Relative Accuracy
Although the original goal was to have all attributes (size, speed, distance from sun) be to scale, it became evident very quickly that this would not be practical on a website. The sun, when to scale with the other planets, took up nearly the entire page. If I made the overall scale smaller to compensate, then planets like Mercury were barely visible. Having orbital distance from the Sun relative to scale of planets made the page so long it was difficult to *find* a planet. 

So, in the interest of making something that still looks reasonable, accuracy is only within certain guides.

* Planetary distances from the sun are proportional to each other.
* Planetary sizes are proportional to each other.
* Planetary orbital speeds are proportional to each other.
* Planetary sizes and distances from the sun are not proportional to each other.
* Orbit speed is not proportional to distances or sizes.
* The sun's size is not proportional.
