# solar-system-model
Just for fun: creating a model of the solar system that semi-accurately represents relative speeds, orbits, rotations, etc.

## Notes
### Relative Accuracy
Although the original goal was to have all attributes (size, speed, distance from sun) be to scale, it became evident very quickly that this would not be practical on a website. The sun, when to scale with the other planets, took up nearly the entire page. If I made the overall scale smaller to compensate, then planets like Mercury were barely visible. So, in the interest of making something that still looks reasonable, accuracy is only within certain guides.

* Planetary distances from the sun are proportional to each other.
* Planetary sizes are proportional to each other.
* Planetary distances from the sun and sizes are not proportional to each other.
* The sun's size is not proportional.
